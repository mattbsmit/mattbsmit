I’m currently a cybersecurity student at BYU - Idaho with technology skills I’ve built over several years. At 15, I began working with tech, building a strong foundation in IT and coding through formal classes and independent learning. After school, you would find me working on certificates related to IT and networking. While my certificates aren't industry leading, they reflect my dedication to learn and commitment to grow a career in cybersecurity.

I’m passionate about protecting systems and data, network defense, and threat analysis. My goal is to enter the field as a reliable and adaptable worker. I’m always seeking new knowledge and hands-on experience to stay ahead in a fast changing field.
